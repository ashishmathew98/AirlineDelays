 **Tools:** Tableau & R
 
 **Data:** [Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/ot_delaycause1.asp)
 
 **Reference:** [Hex-Maps in Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/blog/viz-whiz-hex-tile-maps-64713)

 **Objective:** Analyze airline arrival statistics by state/region, carrier (Delta, SouthWest, etc.) to determine regions with poor airline service

*Note: An airline is reported as a late arrival if the actual arrival time is more than 15 minutes after its scheduled arrival time*

This was driven by FAA staffing shortages at Newark [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/united-says-faa-staffing-shortages-causing-significant-disruption-newark-hub-2024-11-26/)
